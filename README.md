<h1>skiHouse</h1>
Rally your friends, select from one of the US-Rockies' many world-reknown ski resorts, and book your priority reservation dates.
<br></br>
<h2>General Info</h2>
<p>
We are a community of skiers/snowboarders first! Secondly, we're a platform where passholders can reserve priority access at their favorite US-Rockies ski resorts. :blue_heart:
 
Our mission is to:

<li>Facilitate connection amongst community members of each ski pass (Ikon/Epic)</li>
<li>Become the go-to platform for ensuring the community lock in their priority access through our reservation system.</li>
</p>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>

<p>
I was inpired to create this project by the excitement of the upcoming ski season. Skiing is hands down one of my favorite ways to spend a weekend. Integrating a reservation system is also very relevant given the impact that COVID-19 has had on the local ski resorts, as they pivot torwards reservation systems as a way to control traffic and ensure they continue to deliver a best-in-class quality experience to their passholders.
